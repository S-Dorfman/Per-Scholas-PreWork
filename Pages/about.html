      <h4>Yoga</h4>
      <p>
        I enjoy following yoga classes on YouTube since it's quick and
        convenient. I like to do an energizing morning yoga to start my day and
        a relaxing evening yoga to end my day.

      <p class="paragraph">
        I enjoy spending time in the kitchen experimenting with different
        ingredients and spices. I typically don't follow recipes I just throw
        things together in my cast iron pan and whatever comes out is usually
        pretty good. My go to dish is a stir fry with fresh greens, nuts and a
        protien over rice.

      <h3 id="cats">Cats</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I am the proud furr-mom to two cats. They are a girl and boy named Amber
        and Kyte, respectively. I found them in my backyard when they were
        kittens and brought them inside. They are the best lovable, furry and
        purring addition to my life.
